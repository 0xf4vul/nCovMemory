## Introduction

Hello guys, we are a group of Chinese from all over the world gathering together to translate reports on Chinese media about the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia.  By translating reports at first-hand from inside the affected areas in China, we try to afford a panorama of the epidemic situation to the occidental, so as to tackle the issue of xenophobia even to racism against Chinese people worldwide due to information asymmetry.

### Legends
